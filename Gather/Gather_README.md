# This is the readme file for the gather phase of the water crisis project for team *Optimize Prime*
___
All the SQL code is available within the [SQL Code](https://github.com/brandries/Cape_Town_Watercrisis_OptimizePrime/tree/master/Gather/SQL_code) folder

+ With the data provided to us, we firstly created the [Dam Levels Tables](https://github.com/brandries/Cape_Town_Watercrisis_OptimizePrime/blob/master/Gather/Gather_dam_levels.md), 
containing the dam levels, statistics for all the dams, and tables containing the dates at which the readings were taken.

*These date tables will be used throughout the database to link datasets together.*

+ Next we created the [Suburbs](https://github.com/brandries/Cape_Town_Watercrisis_OptimizePrime/blob/master/Gather/Gather_new_suburbs.md)
table. This table is a collection of all the suburbs sampled for the population, consumption and rain datasets, and will
serve as links between these datasets.

+ Following this, we created the [Consumption Tables](https://github.com/brandries/Cape_Town_Watercrisis_OptimizePrime/blob/master/Gather/consumption_manipulation.md), 
which contains data on the consumption of residents, businesses, farms and other plots. 

+ Next, we created the [Population Tables](https://github.com/brandries/Cape_Town_Watercrisis_OptimizePrime/blob/master/Gather/population_manipulation.md), 
which contains data on the number of people in areas all around the greater City of Cape Town, subdivided into other demogrephics.

+ Finally, we created the [Rainfall and Environmental Data Tables](https://github.com/brandries/Cape_Town_Watercrisis_OptimizePrime/blob/master/Gather/rain_manipulation.md),
containing data on rainfall, temperature and windspeed at four locations across the greater Western Cape. 

## Here we can include a picture of the ER diagram
